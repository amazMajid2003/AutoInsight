# --- USER PROMPT ---
USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (
    "Vehicle data (JSON):\n{vehicle_json}\n\n"
    "Scoring guidelines:\n"
    "- Days on Lot (DOL): Longer time on lot increases risk.\n"
    "- Current Price & Price to Market %: Overpriced vehicles increase risk, competitively priced vehicles reduce risk.\n"
    "- Mileage: Higher mileage increases risk; low mileage reduces risk.\n"
    "- Year: Older vehicles increase risk; newer vehicles reduce risk. "
    "Consider current year when evaluating age (e.g. a 2026 vehicle is newer than a 2024 vehicle and should be assessed proportionally).\n"
    "- Total VDPs (lifetime views): More views reduce risk; very few views increase risk. "
    "Normalize the number of VDPs relative to vehicle age—older vehicles are expected to have more views.\n"
    "- Sales Opportunities (lifetime leads): More leads reduce risk; none or few leads increase risk. "
    "Normalize relative to vehicle age as well.\n"
    "- Make/Model: Only for description; do not affect risk score directly.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Always output valid JSON with keys: summary, risk_score, reasoning.\n"
    "- summary: short professional paragraph describing the vehicle. Its selling and purchasing risk including its marketing position.\n"
    "- risk_score: float 1.0–10.0.\n"
    "- reasoning: bullet points, sorted from highest to lowest impact.\n"
    "- No markdown, no formulas, no extra text."
